      earthquake: `An earthquake is a tremor, caused by underground volcanic forces or the breaking or moving of rocks below the earth's surface. Earthquakes usually last only a few seconds, but can last a whole minute. Weaker earthquakes can cause windows and household items to shake, and if they are stronger, the ground can be shaken. The movement causes buildings and other structures to sway or collapse. Earthquake deaths are never caused by earthquakes, but by collapsed buildings and falling objects, broken glass and fires caused by earthquakes.
      During an earthquake
      1. Stay calm. Do not run or let yourself panic. Stay where you are. Most injuries occur when people enter or leave buildings.
      2. If you are inside, hide under a table, bench, chair, stand, distributing your weight evenly on both feet along the walls or under the doors. Watch out for objects that fall, fly or slide towards you. Avoid outside doors, heat sources, stoves, windows, chimneys and heavy objects, such as refrigerators or machines, that can roll over or slide on the floor.
      3. If you are in an apartment building, hide under a table until the shaking stops. Look for a safe place where you are. Do not use elevators to leave the building. Objects falling around the building pose a major risk to your safety. Be careful away from the building.
      4. If you are in a public building, hide under a table or under a door inside the building or a beam. Avoid standing under anything that could fall. Do not run to the exit. If you have to leave, choose the way and the way to the exit carefully. If there is an evacuation plan of the facility to look.
      5. If you are outdoors, go some distance away from buildings, electrical wires or walls, away from bricks or blocks that could fall. When outdoors, lie down or sit on the ground to avoid losing your balance during an earthquake.
      6. If you are in a vehicle, stop driving immediately if safety permits and do not start again until the earthquake is over. Avoid standing near or under buildings, as well as under overpasses, trees or poles. When continuing to drive, pay attention to the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, such as fallen buildings, electric poles and wires, or damaged roads.
      7. If you are trapped in a collapsed building: a. Put a cloth over your mouth and nose to protect yourself from dust; b. Be calm so as not to raise dust; c. Hit (on metal or concrete) to make noise - shouting may not be heard in a large building.`,
      flood: `Flooding is the occurrence of the presence of large amounts of uncontrolled water, which can endanger the life and health of people and cause material damage.
      Evacuation in case of flood
      If you have to leave your home and move temporarily (evacuate) to another location after being instructed by a competent institution, there are a few things to remember and do. Follow the instructions and advice from the competent state and local institutions. If you are instructed to evacuate, do it quickly.
      If you are instructed to go to a specific location, go there and do not go anywhere else. If evacuation routes are listed, use those routes instead of looking for shorter routes. It would be helpful if you were familiar with the routes before you need to travel. If you are told to turn off the water, electricity and heating before leaving home, do so. In case you need water or electricity, ask for information from the competent local institutions, radio or TV stations, where there is organized accommodation and food in case of emergency. Close your home well before leaving. If you have time and have not been instructed to evacuate immediately, take the following steps before leaving home: • Bring yard items inside the house or secure them where they are located. This applies to furniture outside the home, rubbish bins, garden and other tools, as well as any other moving objects that could be carried away by incoming water; • Switch off any electrical appliances or equipment that cannot be moved, but do not touch them if you are watered or standing in water; • Close all windows and lock all doors.`,
      fire: `Keep basements, closets and garages clean. Do not allow the accumulation of garbage and unnecessary items
      Do not overload the extension cords. Check for burns and avoid storing them under carpets. Extension cables for appliances that consume large amounts of electricity should be of the correct length and capacity in accordance with the needs of the appliance
      Keep flammable liquids in packages intended for them and outside the home, if possible. Never use gasoline, oil or the like indoors as their fumes can be ignited by any spark. Towels smeared with detergents or turpentine sometimes ignite on their own and should be discarded immediately after use. Never smoke when working with flammable liquids
      Check the heating appliances. Home fires can be caused by broken stoves or stoves with cracked or rusty parts or by dirty chimneys. Make sure the heating appliances you use are clean and in good condition; Characteristics of R. Macedonia and exposure to risks and dangers
      Recently in the Republic of Macedonia, due to the increased price of electricity and district heating, people are increasingly turning to alternative sources of heating such as wood, coal and the like. These heat sources are prone to fire. Therefore, there should always be sufficient outside ventilation. Provide enough space around the heater and insulate nearby walls. Use fuel intended for your heating appliance. Remove the ash in a metal container outside and away from the house or building. When your heater uses an open fire, keep furniture, curtains and other flammable objects away from it.
      When installing insulation, do not allow electrical wires to pass through it
      It is important to know where the circuit breakers are located so that you can turn them off in the event of a fire.`,
